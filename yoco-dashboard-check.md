# 🔍 Yoco Dashboard Payment Verification

## 🎯 How to Check if Customers Actually Paid

### **Step 1: Access Yoco Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.yoco.com
2. Login with your Yoco account credentials
3. Navigate to "Transactions" or "Payments"

### **Step 2: Filter by Date**
1. Set date filter to September 29, 2025
2. Look for transactions around the time your orders were created
3. Check transaction amounts match your order amounts

### **Step 3: Compare with Your Orders**
Match these details:
- **Transaction Amount** ↔ **Order Total**
- **Transaction Time** ↔ **Order Creation Time**
- **Transaction Status** (should be "Successful")

## 🎯 What Each Scenario Means:

### **✅ Scenario A: Transactions Found in Yoco**
**What it means:**
- Customers DID pay successfully
- Money is in your Yoco account
- Webhook notifications failed to reach your website
- Orders stuck showing "pending" due to technical issue

**What to do:**
1. ✅ You WILL receive the money (already processed)
2. 🔧 Manually update order payment status to "paid"
3. 📦 Process and ship the orders
4. 🔔 Fix webhook for future orders

### **❌ Scenario B: NO Transactions in Yoco**
**What it means:**
- Customers did NOT complete payment
- No money was processed
- Orders were created by system error
- Checkout flow has a bug

**What to do:**
1. ❌ No money is coming
2. 📞 Contact customers to retry payment
3. 🔧 Fix checkout system bug
4. 🚫 Do NOT ship orders until payment confirmed

### **🤔 Scenario C: Partial Transactions**
**What it means:**
- Some customers paid, others didn't
- Mixed situation requiring individual order review

**What to do:**
1. ✅ Ship orders with confirmed Yoco transactions
2. 📞 Contact customers without Yoco transactions
3. 🔧 Investigate why some payments failed

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For:

### **System Bug Indicators:**
- Orders created instantly without payment delay
- All orders show exact same creation time
- No checkout IDs in order data
- Customers claim they never saw payment screen

### **Webhook Issue Indicators:**
- Yoco transactions exist but orders show "pending"
- Time gap between Yoco transaction and order creation
- Orders have checkout IDs but no payment IDs

## 🎯 Immediate Action Plan:

### **If Transactions Found (Scenario A):**
```
1. ✅ Celebrate - you have the money!
2. 🔧 Update order statuses manually
3. 📦 Ship the products
4. 🔔 Fix webhook registration
```

### **If NO Transactions (Scenario B):**
```
1. 🚫 Do NOT ship anything

```
