# Quick Test - Supabase Storage Upload

## Backend is Ready!

The Supabase upload route is now properly configured and matches the frontend's expected endpoint.

### Test It Now:

1. **Restart your local backend** (it should restart automatically with nodemon)

2. **Go to your local admin panel:**
   - http://localhost:3000/admin/products/new

3. **Try uploading an image:**
   - Select a product category (tops, bottoms, etc.)
   - Click to upload an image
   - It should now upload to Supabase Storage!

4. **Check Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to Supabase → Storage → product-images
   - You should see your image there!
   - Copy the URL and test it in your browser

5. **The image URL should look like:**
   ```
   https://[your-project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/product-images/tops/IMAGE-123456.jpeg
   ```

## If It Works Locally:

Deploy to production:

```bash
cd counterfit-app/counterfit-backend
git add routes/upload-supabase.js server.js
git commit -m "Fix: Update Supabase upload endpoints to match frontend"
git push origin main
```

Then wait for Render to deploy and test in production!

## What Changed:

1. ✅ Route renamed from `/api/upload/image` to `/api/upload/product-image`
2. ✅ Route renamed from `/api/upload/images` to `/api/upload/product-images`
3. ✅ Now matches what frontend expects

The 404 error should be gone now!
